Welcome to the **RomM Project**, the ecosystem around the premier self-hosted, open source rom manager.

RomM (ROM Manager) allows you to scan, enrich, and browse your game collection with a clean and responsive interface. With support for multiple platforms, various naming schemes, and custom tags, RomM is a must-have for anyone who plays on emulators.

To get started with RomM, head over to the [Quick Start guide](https://github.com/rommapp/romm/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) in the main repository.

### Philosophy

At the heart of this project is a commitment to freedom, collaboration, and transparency. We believe that software should be built for the benefit of its users, rather than solely to maximize profit or serve the interests of a few stakeholders, ensuring that it doesn't manipulate, exploit, or prioritize data collection.

By offering RomM as a self-hosted, open-source solution, we ensure that everyone has the ability to manage their game collections on their own terms, and own their data, all without being tied to proprietary systems or services.

**Rom is and will always be free and open-source software.**

The core app is licensed under [GNU AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/), which requires that all modifications to the code be made available under the same license. This ensures that the community can benefit from and build upon the contributions of others, promoting trust and transparency.

Other projects under the umbrella will be licensed under similar permissive licenses, such as [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) for software, or [CC0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc0-1.0/) for documentation.

### Contributing

RomM is a collaborative project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Our code is available on GitHub, and we encourage you to contribute to the project by submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests. Please check the contribution guidelines in each project for more information.

### Community

We strive to create a safe and respectful space where everyone can contribute and benefit from the project by fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all users, regardless of their background or identity.
